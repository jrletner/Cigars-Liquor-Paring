# CigarsLiquorParing

This app is my class project for my Codefi Front End Development course.

The objective of this app is to allow the user to:

1. Select a favorite cigar from an API and add it to their own cigar collection, which will be stored on FireBase
2. Select a favorite alcoholic drink from an API and add it to their own liquor collection, which will be stored on FireBase
3. Pair a favorite liquor with a favorite cigar

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.2.
